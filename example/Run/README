This directory contains common files for relocating seismic scatterers.

- CMBout2091 ~ CMBout2891		Travel times at different distances (km) from the surface to seismic scatterer
								for the turning rays, propogating through the outer core.
								The numbers are the assumed depths of the seismic scatterer.

- CMBout20911 ~ CMBout28911		travel times at different distances (km) from the surface to seimic scatterer
								for the direct rays, propogating through the mantle.
								The numbers (without the last 1) are the assumed depths of the seismic scatterer.

- prem1.par						PREM model.

- LocateScatterer.pl			Script for relocating seismic scatterers.

- FindPath.pl					Find travel times at different distances (km) from source depth to seismic scatterer for the turning or direct rays.

- FindPatch.pl					Find the "isotime scatterer arcs" using data from "../Seism".
								t2: handpicked PKP precursor onset
								t9: handpicked PKPdf
								t8: handpicked PKiKP

- FindRaypath.pl				Find ray paths.

- raypath.pl					Calculate the ray path.	

- plot1.pl						Plot the probability and hit counts.
